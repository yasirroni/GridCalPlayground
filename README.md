# GridCalPlayground

Playground to play with GridCal

## Requirements

For GridCal, please use [this branch](https://github.com/yasirroni/gridcal/tree/add_more_data_on_parse_matpower_gen) while waiting [the PR](https://github.com/SanPen/GridCal/pull/153) to be accepted.

To install GridCal from GitHub you need to call `pip install -e .` from the `src` folder instead of root folder.

```bash
cd src
